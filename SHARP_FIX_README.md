# Sharp Linux-x64 Runtime Error Fix

## Problem
The Sharp module was trying to load linux-x64 binaries on macOS, causing the error:
```
Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the linux-x64 runtime
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Cleaned up incorrect binaries
- Removed linux-x64 and linuxmusl-x64 Sharp binaries from `node_modules/@img/`
- Only kept the correct `sharp-darwin-arm64` and `sharp-libvips-darwin-arm64` binaries

### 2. Reinstalled Sharp with correct platform flags
```bash
npm_config_platform=darwin npm_config_arch=arm64 npm install sharp@^0.34.4 --save --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 3. Updated sharp-override.js
- Enhanced error handling for linux runtime errors
- Added platform-specific environment variables
- Improved fallback mechanism

### 4. Updated sharp-init.js  
- Better platform detection and arch handling
- More robust binary verification
- Improved debugging information

### 5. Enhanced next.config.ts
- Added webpack alias to prevent bundling issues
- Better Sharp external configuration

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Development with Sharp overrides (recommended)
- `npm run dev:safe` - Development with environment variables only
- `npm run dev:original` - Original Next.js dev (may have Sharp issues)

## Verification

Sharp is now working correctly:
- ✅ Sharp version: 0.34.4
- ✅ Platform: darwin arm64  
- ✅ Image processing test: SUCCESS!
- ✅ Next.js dev server: WORKING
- ✅ Sharp rebuild: COMPLETED

## Final Fix Applied

The final solution was to rebuild Sharp with the correct platform flags:
```bash
npm_config_platform=darwin npm_config_arch=arm64 npm rebuild sharp
```

This ensured that Sharp was compiled specifically for macOS ARM64 architecture.

## Future Prevention

1. Always use platform-specific installation when dealing with Sharp
2. Use the `npm run dev` script which includes Sharp overrides
3. If Sharp issues recur, run: `npm rebuild sharp`

## Files Modified

- `sharp-override.js` - Enhanced error handling
- `sharp-init.js` - Better platform detection  
- `next.config.ts` - Improved webpack configuration
- `package.json` - Scripts already included proper overrides
